    <h1>My favourite hobby<br>playing Cricket</h1>
    <section id="bio">
        <p>Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each. One team, which is batting, tries to score runs , while the other team is fielding, and tries to prevent this. Runs are scored by hitting the ball, which is thrown by a player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary, or by the batting team's players running between two areas of the field called the batsmen's grounds as many times as possible before the fielding team successfully hits a wicket (set of sticks) in either of the grounds with the ball to get them out.My favourite hobby is playing cricket as it is really fun. Playing sports is a very good way to increase our health.Playing cricket makes me more happier and energetic.
